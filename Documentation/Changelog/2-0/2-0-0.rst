Breaking changes
----------------
- Instead of the dedicated TypoScript `PAGE` type `klaroConfiguration` with `typeNum = 1699541845`. If middleware is now used to transfer a standalone configuration to third-party systems. The URL entry point is now uniformly `/klaro-config.js`.
- The fluid styled content layout `EXT:cms_fluid_styled_content/Resources/Private/Layouts/Default.html` is now overwritten via `lib.contentElement.layoutRootPaths.1720091199`. If you want to make the necessary additions in your own layout file, you must empty the contents of this key via `lib.contentElement.layoutRootPaths.1720091199 >`.
