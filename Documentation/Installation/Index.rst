Installation
============

There are different ways an extension in TYPO3 can be installed. This also applies to this extension.

Composer
========

If your TYPO3 instance was installed with Composer (recommended), then this extension must also be installed via Composer. In this case, follow the chapter:

..  toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1
   :titlesonly:

   Composer/Index

Classic
=======

Otherwise, you can take the classic route and choose whether to download the extension as a zip archive from the TYPO3 Extension Repository (TER) and import it into the Extension Manager or whether to search for and install it directly in the Extension Manager. In this case, follow the chapter:

..  toctree::
