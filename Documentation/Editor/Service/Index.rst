=======
Service
=======

A Klaro **service** contains all information on a specific area of application of the website that requires consent and is assigned to a :ref:`configuration <for-editors-configuration>`. Services are usually listed in the Consent Management Modal. However, there are also services that are only used in the context of contextual consent and do not appear in the modal. This section explains all the functions that can be selected in the context of these services in Klaro.

It often happens that a service has to set :ref:`cookies <for-editors-cookie>` in the browser. These are recorded in the service configuration as dedicated inline records.

The points in the following navigation correspond to the tabs that are available in the backend form of a Klaro service of the respective records and the subpages correspond to the palettes that are used to group related fields within a tab.
