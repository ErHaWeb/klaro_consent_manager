For Editors
===========

After installing this extension, you are able to create a Klaro **configuration** that is later referenced via the site configuration of the site for which Consent Management is to be set up.

**Services** are referenced via the Klaro configuration. Services can also be created independently of editing the Klaro configuration. In the context of editing services, information on the **cookies** used by the service in question can be specified inline.

General setup
=============

You can set up Consent Management in the following way:

..  rst-class:: bignums-tip

1.  Create **services** including associated **cookies**

2.  Create a Klaro **configuration** and reference the services

3.  Reference the Klaro configuration in the site configuration

Detailed information
====================

Here you will find information about all fields that can be configured for the **configuration**, **services** and **cookies**. The subpages correspond to the tabs that are available in the backend form of the respective record.
